# City Science - frontend dev task

The links below all give information on traffic count and major road data.

* Data: <https://storage.googleapis.com/dft-statistics/road-traffic/downloads/data-gov-uk/dft_traffic_counts_aadf_by_direction.zip>
* Metadata: <https://storage.googleapis.com/dft-statistics/road-traffic/all-traffic-data-metadata.pdf>
* General info: <https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/about>

We would like you to create a web app that visualises some small aspect of this data.

## FAQ

1. Do I need to host it somewhere?: Yes. We would like to try using it. It will only need to be up for a few days.
2. Do I need to share the code?: Yes. We would like to review it. Either make it public or add esc24 as collaborator on github.com or gitlab.com
3. Do I need to add auth? No. The data is publicly available so access control is not required.
